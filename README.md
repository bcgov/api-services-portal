## Introduction

The `API Services Portal` is a frontend for API Providers to manage the lifecycle of their APIs and for Developers to discover and access these APIs. It works in combination with the Kong Community Edition Gateway and Keycloak IAM solution.

## Running the Project.

### Installation

#### 1. Manual

To run this project first run `npm install`.

This application requires to have an Authentication proxy in front of it. Go to [oauth2-proxy](oauth2-proxy) for instructions on starting the proxy locally.

You can then run `npm run dev` to start the application on port 3000. The proxy runs on port 4180.

```
hostip=$(ifconfig en0 | awk '$1 == "inet" {print $2}')

export AUTH_STRATEGY=Oauth2Proxy
export ADAPTER=knex
export KNEX_HOST=$hostip
export KNEX_DATABASE=keystonejs
export KNEX_USER=""
export KNEX_PASSWORD=""
export MONGO_URL=mongodb://$hostip:17017/keystonedb3
export MONGO_USER=""
export MONGO_PASSWORD=""

export FEEDER_URL=http://localhost:6000

export KONG_URL=""
export OIDC_ISSUER=""
export JWKS_URL=${OIDC_ISSUER}/protocol/openid-connect/certs

export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ROOT=http://localhost:4180
export SSR_API_ROOT=http://localhost:4180
export EXTERNAL_URL="http://localhost:4180"

export GWA_API_URL=http://localhost:2000

npm run dev
```

Once running, the `api services portal` application is reachable via `localhost:4180`.

#### 2. Docker

##### Steps

1. Create a `.env` from `.env.local` file
2. Create a `.env` from `.env.local` file under `feeds` directory
3. Run `docker-compose up` to spin up a local development environment with services (Postgres, Keycloak, OAuth2-proxy, APS-Portal, Feeder and Kong Gateway)
4. Go to: http://oauth2proxy.localtest.me:4180
5. To login, use username `local` and password `local`, or username `awsummer@idir` and password `awsummer`
6. `docker-compose down` : Removes all the hosted services

##### Note:

- Please wait until keycloak service starts and is initialized with `master` realm. The realm configuration is saved in `./keycloak/master-realm.json`. It also creates a realm user `local` with admin privileges.
- You may want to run `docker-compose build` if there are new changes that are not reflected in the last time you built the container images

## Design

The `API Services Portal` is a React application using the Chakra UI component library, and using two frameworks: KeystoneJS V5, and NextJS.

The application is divided up into the following six components:

### 1. Data Model

The KeystoneJS lists define the aggregated data model that makes up this application.

Source: `src/lists/*`

### 2. UI

The actual pages and components for the `API Services Portal`.

Source: `src/nextapp/*`

### 3. Authentication

Support for an OAuth2-Proxy was added to allow authenticating with an OAuth2 flow. A Token is passed on to the KeystoneJS backend and our middleware verifies the token and starts a session.

Source: `src/auth/auth-oauth2-proxy.js`

### 4. Authorization

A decision matrix and authorization rules engine is implemented to centralize the rules around access to data.

It uses Permissions retrieved for the logged in user and a particular `Namespace` Resource. The Requesting Party Token (RPT) holding the permissions will be maintained in the KeystoneJS Session and refreshed accordingly.

Switching namespaces will result in getting a new RPT that has the relevant permission for the user for the `Namespace`.

### 6. Feeders

A set of feeders that live close to the external sources for reading and sending data to the Ingestor

Currently support feeders:

## Development

#### TypeScript

The client-side Next.js application uses TypeScript, and because it plays nicely with GraphQL types, uses a codegen to generate the API types.
In `development` mode once the API server has started the types are automatically generated, but will need to be regenerated if you make changes to the
GraphQL schemas while the dev server is running.

If you want to manually build the types, first ensure the API server is running at `http://localhost:3000/admin/api` and run `$ npm run generate`

A `queries.types.ts` file is generated at `src/nextapp/shared/types`.

Example usage:

```typescript
import type { Query } from '@/types/queries.types';

const Component = () => {
   const { data } = useQuery<Query>(...);

   return (
     <div>{data.allPackages.map(...)}</div>
   )
}

```

All Typescript paths alias `src/nextapp` to `@/`.

#### Storybook

[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) was chosen for the UI framework due to its utility and flexibility. A theme has been created which follows the [BC Government Web Design System](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Design-System) alongside custom components written for the portal.

Storybook has been installed to demonstrate and preview custom components. To view run `$ npm run storybook`.

Core components like buttons and form elements have their own Chakra theme variant, all set by default so using a button like so;

```jsx
import { Button } from 'chakra-ui/react';

// Renders as a BC Primary Button
<Button>Primary<Button>

// or the longhand declarative version
<Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
```

All the core components stories are located in `src/stories`. For custom components add the story in the component folder, ie `src/nextapp/components/card/card.stories.tsx`.

#### Mock Server

For convenience a mock server is available to fake data via the GraphQL api. Run by opening a new shell window after running `$ npm run dev` and run the following:

```shell
$ cd src/
$ npm run mock-server
```

In `./src/.env.local` assign the Next and GWA `API_ROOT` values to the following

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ROOT=http://localhost:4000
GWA_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

It should be noted that a 1-to-1 replication of the production API is not the goal of the mock server. It's simply to replicate requests and confirm the content returned will behave in an expected way.

###### Updating mock server schemas

When Keystone-level types are updated, there is a manual step required for the mock server in order to keep the mock data structure in sync with the production server. It is definitely manual at the moment, but fairly easy and quick to do.

1. After the Keystone dev server has started (`$ npm run dev`), open [http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql)
2. The far right of the graphiql interface are 2 tabs, `DOCS` and `SCHEMAS`. You can either download and copy or copy the contents of the `SCHEMAS` tab and paste it in `src/test/mock-server/schemas.js` inside the string literal.
3. Delete any instances of a `@deprecated(reason: "Use `path` instead")` string. These messages break the graphql-tools

#### Coding Style

There isn't a strict, repo-wide coding style per se, but we use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent code style. Both libraries are included locally as part of the node_modules, so it is recommended to configure your editor to run off local versions instead of global so any API changes between versions don't collide.

Keep your code neat with easy to understand variable names, common sense verbosity is encouraged so anyone can understand what the code does.

```javascript
// don't
const x = a + b;

if (x) c(x);

// do

const sumOfItems = itemA + itemB;

if (sumOfItems) {
  runResultOfSums(sumOfItems);
}

// you can use abbreviations for iterations though, as long as the list is explicit
const newItemsMapped = allNewItems.map((a) => ({ ...a, newKey: 'a' }));
```

### Database (KNex)

When using Postgres as a backend, there is limited support for migrations. So need to come up with a process for `upgrading` databases.

```
select 'drop table "' || tablename || '" cascade;' from pg_tables where schemaname='public';
```

In the mean time, it is possible to drop the tables and re-run the `init-aps-portal-keystonejs-batch-job`.
